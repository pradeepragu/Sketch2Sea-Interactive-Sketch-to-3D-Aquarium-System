We present an interactive sketch-to-3D visualization system that bridges physical drawing and digital rendering. The system leverages computer vision for foreground extraction and integrates user-generated silhouettes into a dynamic WebGL-rendered underwater environment. The approach demonstrates a lightweight, browser-based pipeline for interactive content creation without reliance on heavy game engines.
